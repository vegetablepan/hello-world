# hello-world
first step in GitHub
I'm Penny, this is my first try in GitHub and it's amazing.
I got to know GitHub from Intro to Programing in Udacity and from my engineering friends.
I've just created a repository called hello-world and created a branch called readme-edits.
still not sure what README means.
<b>Keeping moving.
Be a lifelong learner.</b>
